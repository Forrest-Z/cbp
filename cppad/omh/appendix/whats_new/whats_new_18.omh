$section Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2018$$

$head 02-26$$
The routine $cref sparse2eigen$$, added on 02-20, only worked
when the values in the matrix were integers.
This bug has been fixed.

$head 02-23$$
The syntax for some of the $cref utility$$ files were missing the
$code # include$$ command (or just the $code #$$ in the include command);
e.g., see the
$cref/syntax/set_union/Syntax/$$ for the $code set_union$$ utility.

$head 02-20$$
Add the utility function $cref sparse2eigen$$.

$end
